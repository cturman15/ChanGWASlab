# NHS/NHSII/HPFS/PHS GWAS Studies

The Nurses' Health Study (NHS), Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII), Health Professionals Follow
Up Study (HPFS) and the Physicians Health Study (PHS) have collected detailed longitudinal
data on multiple exposures and traits for approximately 310,000 study participants
over the last 40 years. 

In 2017, over 160,000 study participants across the cohorts have donated a DNA sample and
20,691 subjects have been genotyped as part of genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
of twelve primary outcomes. However, these studies utilized six different GWAS arrays making
it difficult to conduct analyses of secondary phenotypes or share controls across studies. 
To allow for secondary analyses of these data, we have created three new datasets merged
by platform family and performed imputation using a common reference panel, the 1,000 Genomes
Phase I release.

genetic variation in 20,691 subjects from four large cohorts. PLoS ONE.(2017);PMID: 28301549](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5354293/)

Since 2017, more samples have been genotyped using the same and different genotyping arrays. 
To date, over 44, 000 subjects have been genotyped. We have created five datasets 
([Table 1])(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i8Tl8p1VM2HMXRtavLaLsO1wxT_JeWH-vtNW7aKhnpw/edit?usp=sharing)
of seventeen primary outcomes ([Table 2]).(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PLOWKqM6Lb15C3e7IIM1VwsAT7H0VJ1QWsVNZSgGitw/edit?usp=sharing)

We performed imputations using newer reference panels, 1,000 Genomes 
Phase III release, Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) release I, and Trans-Omics for Precision 
Medicine (TOPMed) release II.
