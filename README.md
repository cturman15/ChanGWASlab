# NHS/NHSII/HPFS/PHS GWAS Studies

## Introduction

The Nurses' Health Study (NHS), Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII), Health Professionals Follow Up Study (HPFS) and the Physicians Health Study (PHS) have collected detailed longitudinal data on multiple exposures and traits for approximately 310,000 study participants over the last 40 years. Over 160,000 study participants across the cohorts have donated a DNA sample and to date, over 44,000 subjects have been genotyped as part of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of seventeen primary outcomes. However, these studies utilized different GWAS arrays making it difficult to conduct analyses of secondary phenotypes or share controls across studies. To allow for secondary analyses of these data, we have created five datasets merged by platform family ([Table 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i8Tl8p1VM2HMXRtavLaLsO1wxT_JeWH-vtNW7aKhnpw/edit?usp=sharing "Table 1. Numbers of GWAS samples in NHS/NHSII/HPFS/PHS cohorts")). The previous version of three datasets were presented in [[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5354293/ "Lindström S, Loomis S, Turman C, Huang H, Huang J, Aschard H, et al. A comprehensive survey of genetic variation in 20,691 subjects from four large cohorts. PLoS ONE.(2017);PMID: 28301549")].

We performed imputation using common reference panels, 1,000 Genomes Phase III release, Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) release I, and Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) release II. This pooled resource can be used to maximize power in GWAS of phenotypes collected across the cohorts and for studying gene-environment interactions as well as rare phenotypes and genotypes.  

## GWAS studies and genotyping 

Since 2007, seventeen separate GWAS have been conducted within these four cohorts ([Table 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PLOWKqM6Lb15C3e7IIM1VwsAT7H0VJ1QWsVNZSgGitw/edit?usp=sharing "Table 2. GWAS datasets in NHS/NHSII/HPFS/PHS cohorts")). The primary traits are breast cancer, colon cancer, coronary heart disease, endometrial cancer, endometriosis, glaucoma, gout, kidney stone, mammographic density, melanoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, post-traumatic stress disorder, prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, type 2 diabetes and Venous thromboembolism. These studies were genotyped on five different arrays. Standard quality control filters for call rate, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and other measures were applied to the genotyped variants or/and samples in the individual studies. We performed principal component analysis. The majority of genotyped subjects are Europeans. Non-European samples were excluded.
