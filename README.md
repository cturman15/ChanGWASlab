# NHS/NHS2/HPFS/PHS GWAS Studies

The Nurses' Health Study (NHS), Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII), Health Professionals Follow
Up Study (HPFS) and the Physicians Health Study (PHS) have collected detailed longitudinal
data on multiple exposures and traits for approximately 310,000 study participants
over the last 35 years. Over 160,000 study participants across the cohorts have donated a
DNA sample and to date, 20,691 subjects have been genotyped as part of genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) of twelve primary outcomes. However, these studies utilized
six different GWAS arrays making it difficult to conduct analyses of secondary phenotypes
or share controls across studies. To allow for secondary analyses of these data, we have
created three new datasets merged by platform family and performed imputation using a
common reference panel, the 1,000 Genomes Phase I release.

genetic variation in 20,691 subjects from four large cohorts. PLoS ONE.(2017);PMID: 28301549](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5354293/)

Since 2017, more samples have been genotyped using the same and different GWAS arrays. We have
created five datasets and performed imputions using newer reference panels, 1,000 Genomes 
Phase III release, Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) release I, and Trans-Omics for Precision 
Medicine (TOPMed) release II. 

Here, we provide updates on ...
