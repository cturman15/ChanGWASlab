# NHS/NHSII/HPFS/PHS GWAS Studies

The Nurses' Health Study (NHS), Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII), Health Professionals Follow
Up Study (HPFS) and the Physicians Health Study (PHS) have collected detailed longitudinal
data on multiple exposures and traits for approximately 310,000 study participants
over the last 40 years. 

In 2017, over 160,000 study participants across the cohorts have donated a
DNA sample and to date, 20,691 subjects have been genotyped as part of genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) of twelve primary outcomes.

genetic variation in 20,691 subjects from four large cohorts. PLoS ONE.(2017);PMID: 28301549](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5354293/)

Since 2017, more samples have been genotyped using the same and different GWAS arrays. We have
created five datasets and performed imputions using newer reference panels, 1,000 Genomes 
Phase III release, Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) release I, and Trans-Omics for Precision 
Medicine (TOPMed) release II.
